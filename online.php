<h2>Myphone a919 DUO-white</h2>
    <center><img src="images/myphone a919 duo-iloilo-philippines.jpg"/></center>
<p>If you’ve been holding out for an affordable dual-core, dual-SIM smartphone with a big-ass display, then you’re in luck. Say hello to the Samsung Galaxy S III’s cousin MyPhone A919 Duo, the forthcoming 5-inch Android variant from the guys responsible for the 4.3-inch MyPhone A878 Duo.

    Officially priced cheaper than most kids on the block, especially considering how massive this thing is, the A919 Duo will retail at P7,999.

Designed to go toe-to-toe with other China-bred Android heavyweights, the MyPhone A919 Duo nudges itself towards phablet territory, wielding a 5-inch touchscreen which benefits from in-plane switching [IPS] for improved viewing angles and outdoor visibility.

    Equally impressive—at least on paper—are its insides, which make use of a MediaTek MT6577 processor with two cores clocked at 1GHz, similar to those of the Cherry Mobile Titan and the Starmobile Astra. Operation is buffered by a PowerVR SGX531 graphics chip and 512MB of RAM.

    Underneath the removable cover is a microSD expansion slot to complement the reasonably paltry 4GB of flash memory and a 2000mAh cell to hopefully keep the phone up past the first day. The 8-megapixel optic round the MyPhone A919 Duo’s back likely figures to deliver satisfying results even in dimmer conditions given the presence of dual-LED flash modules.

    According to a MyPhone executive, the A919 Duo ships with Android Ice Cream </p>

<p>This beauty from my!phone is dual sim and costs only PhP 5,990 and is feature-packed.  Infact it claims to do what blackberry does in a cheaper manner.  I like this one better if only it comes in red. It boasts of a 3.2 megapixel camera, bluetooth connectivity, and wifi.  What else would you need?

    But really i have been itching to buy an underwater camera for sometime.  Not that, i have any plans of scuba diving soon.  My children are mermaids.  Abby particularly, sometimes wears her pink necklace, touches it and says " I want to be human." During our ferry boat rides from liloan ,leyte to lipata, surigao city when we were sailing beneath the stars and i told them to make a wish because i saw a shooting star, they wished that they become mermaids.  And i told them to shut up( He he).  Good parenting huh?! Seriously, they take to water like ducks. If it were upto me, i would spend every other weekend near a body of water just so they would really swim and play to their hearts content.
    So an underwater camera would really be a dream right?</p>

<h2>q22 duo myphone (1)</h2>

<p>The phone looks so sophisticated in its black and red color, the qwerty keypad makes it look more appealing and will surely thrill someone to grab this kind of phone. It is slim and light, seems all the physical feature of the phone looks so amazing and enticing plus the fact that this phone is so affordable for all walks of life.

    The video recording is also slow and not producing real time captures. The audio also is too loud to the point that it may sound crappy. I can't even customize my theme which is the very poor feature of the phone. The only thing I like about it is the battery that can last for almost a week.JUST VISIT TO GOOGLE AND CLIK BAKAL CELLPHONE SA ROXAS CITY</p>

<h2>MyPhone A868 DUO Price and Specs</h2>
<center><img src="images/MyPhone A868 DUO Price and Specs.JPG"></center>
<p>MyPhone A868 DUO is A858 with 3G on board and front-facing VGA camera. They have the same specs but the capability of 3G internet is a big difference.
</p>

<h2>Myphone A878</h2>
<img src="images/Myphone A878.jpg">
<p>Not to be taken lightly, the MyPhone A878 Duo is another Android smartphone for the masses. Souped up by Android Ice Cream Sandwich, decently specced, and cheaper than most of the competition at P6,999, MyPhone’s budget handset is quite the heavyweight on paper.

    For starters, the MyPhone A878 Duo has a 4.3-inch LCD display, which boasts IPS technology for wider viewing angles and better color reproduction. Things go upmarket again with a dual-core 1GHz mobile processor and a 5-megapixel main cam with auto-focus and LED flash. It helps that it has a 1800mAh battery to offset the rather large display and speedy computing chip.

    Akin to other low-priced Androids, MyPhone’s A878 Duo is a dual-SIM handset, allowing you to use your business and personal mobile numbers with it.

    The only drawback (again, on paper) is that the phone lacks 3G connectivity, which is essential if wireless Internet access ranks high on your priority list. That’s not such a bad thing, though, especially considering the rest of what you’re getting.

    The MyPhone A878 Duo isn’t a product of first-tier phone makers, but it’s certainly worth checking out if you’re after an inexpensive Android Ice Cream Sandwich experience. For the specs alone—a rarity even in today’s cutthroat mobile market—it’s probably worth your time.</p>


<h2>A888 Duo</h2>
<center><img src="images/A888 Duo.png"></center>
<p>It’s official, my|phone fan page posted an update to announce their latest Android phone offering, taking the name: myphone A888 Duo. Its a dual core Android phone, with 4.5 inch of IPS screen at qHD resolution. Catch more info about the MyPhone A888 Duo after the jump.While many of the geeks have been expecting to see a quad-core here on the A888 model, I just think its really too early for that. What we have here on this official myphone A888 duo is a dual-core with 1GHz clock-speed which is not bad at all. On another note, I see people saying that its just a downgrade of the 5-inch myPhone A919 phablet, its kind of but not that actually as they have a lot of differences and edge.

    Lets take a look first on the specs and features of this myPhone A888 Duo:
    MyPhone A888 Duo Specs and Features

    As posted by myPhone, source. MyPhone A888 Duo key features:

    1GHz dual core + Dual SIM.
    Android 4.0.4 (ICS) OS.
    512MB RAM, 4GB internal memory and microSD card support up to 32GB.
    4.5-inch capacitive IPS touchscreen. Resolution qHD (540×960 pixels).
    3G, 2G, Wi-Fi, GPS, 3.5mm jack, Bluetooth 4.0 and micro USB.
    8MP rear autofocus and front 1.3MP camera. Dual LED flash. HD 720p video recording.
    Sensors : Proximity, Motion and Light sensor
    1800 mAh Lithium polymer battery.
    8.9mm slim
    Dual mic noise reduction
    Turn to mute function
You cannot fully say that this is just a myphone a919 downgrade as there are some parameters on the specs sheet that makes itself superior with the a919. Noticeably, the smaller screen size and battery capacity might be a reason for cost-cutting on this phone as to have a price that is lower than its 5-inch predecessor. However, its 4.5 inch qHD screen obviously screams a better slate here compared to the a919.

    Overall, not surprising though it could gone better if the RAM was bumped at 1GB so as to somehow had the chance to soar on its 4.5-inch category bracket on our local smartphones scene.I tried to check out on those 4.5-inch China phones I had saw but none of the exactly matches the looks of the a888 duo. Might be too early to say now, but Im pretty sure we’ll know that in the future. Well you might ask why bother to know about this? This is very important, I’ll just sum it up to be short: to know the feedback and reviews of foreign users, and lastly to get more community support for the phone if there are already some developers or community that is working on tweaks and updates with the device.
    Price and Availability

    The posted price of the myphone a888 duo is P7,499. Not sure if its the final price, as it was just posted as the introductory price. We cannot say if it will go up or down. Well for you, what can you say about the pricing?Not mentioned as well if its already available in stores right now. We’ll see if I could be able to do a hands-on with this new myphone a888 duo. I’ll keep you posted.</p>
