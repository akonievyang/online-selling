Not to be taken lightly, the MyPhone A878 Duo is another Android smartphone for the masses. Souped up by Android Ice Cream Sandwich, decently specced, and cheaper than most of the competition at P6,999, MyPhone’s budget handset is quite the heavyweight on paper.

For starters, the MyPhone A878 Duo has a 4.3-inch LCD display, which boasts IPS technology for wider viewing angles and better color reproduction. Things go upmarket again with a dual-core 1GHz mobile processor and a 5-megapixel main cam with auto-focus and LED flash. It helps that it has a 1800mAh battery to offset the rather large display and speedy computing chip.

Akin to other low-priced Androids, MyPhone’s A878 Duo is a dual-SIM handset, allowing you to use your business and personal mobile numbers with it.

The only drawback (again, on paper) is that the phone lacks 3G connectivity, which is essential if wireless Internet access ranks high on your priority list. That’s not such a bad thing, though, especially considering the rest of what you’re getting.

The MyPhone A878 Duo isn’t a product of first-tier phone makers, but it’s certainly worth checking out if you’re after an inexpensive Android Ice Cream Sandwich experience. For the specs alone—a rarity even in today’s cutthroat mobile market—it’s probably worth your time.
