If you’ve been holding out for an affordable dual-core, dual-SIM smartphone with a big-ass display, then you’re in luck. Say hello to the Samsung Galaxy S III’s cousin MyPhone A919 Duo, the forthcoming 5-inch Android variant from the guys responsible for the 4.3-inch MyPhone A878 Duo.

Officially priced cheaper than most kids on the block, especially considering how massive this thing is, the A919 Duo will retail at P7,999.

Designed to go toe-to-toe with other China-bred Android heavyweights, the MyPhone A919 Duo nudges itself towards phablet territory, wielding a 5-inch touchscreen which benefits from in-plane switching [IPS] for improved viewing angles and outdoor visibility.

Equally impressive—at least on paper—are its insides, which make use of a MediaTek MT6577 processor with two cores clocked at 1GHz, similar to those of the Cherry Mobile Titan and the Starmobile Astra. Operation is buffered by a PowerVR SGX531 graphics chip and 512MB of RAM.

Underneath the removable cover is a microSD expansion slot to complement the reasonably paltry 4GB of flash memory and a 2000mAh cell to hopefully keep the phone up past the first day.

According to a MyPhone executive, the A919 Duo ships with Android Ice Cream
