The phone looks so sophisticated in its black and red color, the qwerty keypad makes it look more appealing and will surely thrill someone to grab this kind of phone. It is slim and light, seems all the physical feature of the phone looks so amazing and enticing plus the fact that this phone is so affordable for all walks of life.

 The video recording is also slow and not producing real time captures. The audio also is too loud to the point that it may sound crappy. I can't even customize my theme which is the very poor feature of the phone. The only thing I like about it is the battery that can last for almost a week.JUST VISIT TO GOOGLE AND CLIK BAKAL CELLPHONE SA ROXAS CITY
